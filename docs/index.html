          <h4>The millenium fellowship is a semester long leadership development program
            that elevates leadership.  Students come together to work on a project
            which helps to bring your campus community closer to one of the seventeen goals
            for global development </h4>

            <h4>We will offer green consulting solutions to Loyola Marymount University
              administration to make campus operations more sustainable, while also educating
              the student body. Our two main objectives are to promote sustainable lighting
              and power sourcing, which are both sustainable for the environment and cost
              efficient for the university. <br>
              <br>
              First, L.E.D. lighting is about 8% cheaper than the fluorescent lighting
              that is currently common across campus. Next, power strips and outlets with
              on/off switches stop the unnecessary flows of energy when such power points
              are not in use. Additionally, motion sensor lighting can regulate when lights
              are powered on, as opposed to current 24 hour activation. This prevents costs
              of unnecessary energy consumption. Many universities worldwide already use
              such tactics, and it's time LMU joins them in doing right by the planet. </br>
              <br>
              Our team brings together multiple disciplines from LMU’s Colleges of Business,
              Science & Engineering, Liberal Arts, and Film & Television to collaborate on
              our goals from scientific, fiscal, and social perspectives. We aspire to
              educate both our administrators and the student body on the efficiency of
              green alternatives in a multidisciplinary way. By implementing and advocating
              for sustainable energy solutions, we hope to position LMU for a greener future.</h4>

          <h4> Loyola Marymount University has made a massive step towards carbon neutrality,
          aspiring to align its Westchester campus with the UNited Nations Sustainable
          Development Goal #11, Sustainable Cities and Communities. In addition to recent
          efforts to sustainably source more energy by means of solar panels and commitments
          to divest from fossil fuel industry holdings, the office of the President has
          committed to a plan to transition all indoor lighting from fluorescent to LED by the
          year 2025. Additionally, the office has announced that all available outlets on campus
          will be equipped with switches within the same timeframe. <br>
          <br>
          While this change may sound small, the investment is expected to cut energy costs by
          millions in the years to follow. Further, by embracing this project, LMU is able to
          move its goal carbon neutrality date up from 2050 to 2038. Purchase of externally
          sourced electricity remains LMU's greatest direct contribution to Greenhouse Gas
          emissions, but with the help of this initiative backed by the UN Millennium Fellowship,
           LMU is well on its way to 0% external electricity purchase! </h4>

            First and foremost, our group members will be able to communicate remotely. All
            formal proposals can be developed virtually, and in turn, informational exchanges
            can be executed via video conferencing. Our project also has a growing amount of
            faculty support, and this network should allow us to facilitate positive and
            consistent communication with college deans and administrators. </h4>
